# P1: Bay Area Bike Data Analysis
For this initial project, you’ll step right into a data analyst’s shoes by investigating a raw dataset, and sharing your findings using a Jupyter Notebook. You’ll be working with real data provided by Bay Area Bike Share to determine differences in usage between commuters and tourists ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more!
