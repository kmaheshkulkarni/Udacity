A decision tree is classically an algorithm that can be easy to overfit; one of the easiest ways to get an overfit decision tree is to use a small training set and lots of features.\n",

    "A classic way to overfit an algorithm is by using lots of features and not a lot of training data. You can find the starter code in feature_selection/find_signature.py.
